# jQuery Visibility <sup>[1.0.1](https://github.com/alexanevsky/visibility/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)</sup>

Worked as FadeToggle() and SlideToggle().

The actions 'slide' and 'fade' are performed sequentially.


Using:
```javascript
$(element).visibilityToggle(400);
$(element).visibilityShow(400);
$(element).visibilityHide(400);
```
